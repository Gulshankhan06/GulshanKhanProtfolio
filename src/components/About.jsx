      Hi ! I’m Gulshan Khan, a passionate Web Developer who enjoys creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites.

 I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, along with a solid background in C, C++, and Java.

 Some of the projects I’ve built include:

A Calculator Web App (simple and responsive UI)

Tic Tac Toe Game (interactive and fun logic-based project)

 Kinetic Connect Agency(A modern and responsive digital marketing website designed to showcase services like SEO, PPC, and social media strategies.Built using [ React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS].This project helped me strengthen my skills in responsive design, UI/UX, and creating a professional brand website.)

 I completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from Vikram University, which gave me a strong foundation in computer science and software development.

 I’m always curious to explore new tools and technologies, improve my coding skills, and collaborate with others in building impactful projects.

 Open to connections, collaborations, and opportunities in web development — let’s connect and grow together!
